To get an odd sum, we need an odd number of odd numbers. This means k must be odd.  Therefore, k can be 1, 3, 5,..., n if n is odd, and 1, 3, 5,..., n-1 if n is even. The number of such subsets is exactly half of the total number of subsets of size n. Hence the answer is C(2n, n)/2.

Also, since p is odd, p-1 is even, therefore (p-1)(p-2) is divisible by 2. Consequently, (p-1)(p-2) is divisible by 12. Similarly, if p = 6k+5, then (p-1)(p-2) = (6k+4)(6k+3) = 2(3k+2)3(2k+1) = 6(3k+2)(2k+1). This is divisible by 6. If k is even, (3k+2) is even, and if k is odd, 2k+1 is even.

In base b, the equation is x\u00b2 - (1*b + 0)x + (1*b + 1) = 0.  Substituting x = 2 and x = 3, the solution is a bit trickier. Let's use Vieta's formulas. The sum of roots is 5 (base b) = 5. The product of roots is 6 (base b) = 6.  In base 10, the equation becomes x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0.  However, the roots are given in base b. Let's consider (x-2)(x-3) = 0 in base b. This gives x\u00b2 - (2+3)x + 6 = 0. Since we have a 5 in the original equation, this gives a contradiction. Let's try another approach.  If x = 2 and x = 3 are the roots in base b, then the equation is (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0.  Expanding this gives x\u00b2 - 5x + 6 = 0 (in base 10). Since the coefficients are given in base b, we need to find a base b where 5 (base 10) and 6 (base 10) are represented in base b as 5<sub>b</sub> and 6<sub>b</sub>. This condition is satisfied for any base b>6. It looks like the problem statement has some ambiguity.  However, if we assume the question intends that the roots are 2 and 3 in base 10, then the equation is correct as is. If the roots are 2 and 3 in any base b > 3, then the base b expansion of the quadratic equation would be different. The question is flawed.",

Decreasing engines by 25% gives 0.75x engines and time becomes 2t. So 2t \u221d 1/(0.75x). From the first relation: (2/3)t = k/(1.5x), where k is the constant of proportionality. From the second relation: 2t = k/(0.75x). Dividing the second equation by the first: 3 = (1.5x)/(0.75x) = 2, which is a contradiction, indicating a flaw in our assumption that the time is strictly inversely proportional. However, considering a proportional relationship of the form t = k/(x^n) we get (2/3)t = k/(1.5x)^n and 2t = k/(0.75x)^n.

The relative speed is still 135 km/h. Time to meet = 195/135 hours = 13/9 hours. Distance traveled by A = 60 * (13/9) = 86.67 km. This is incorrect.

When A starts 1 hour later, train B travels 75km in that hour. Distance left is 195 km. The relative speed is 135 km/h.

If a, b, c are in arithmetic progression, then 2b = a + c. Substituting into a + b + c = 6, we get 3b = 6, so b = 2.  Then a + c = 4.  Substituting b = 2 into ab + bc + ca = 11 gives 2a + 2c + ac = 11, and since a + c = 4, we get ac = 3. Then a and c are roots of x\u00b2 - 4x + 3 = 0, giving a = 1, c = 3 (or vice versa). Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 = 14.

Therefore, 100(1 + x/100) + 150(1 - y/100) = 250. This simplifies to 100 + x + 150 - 1.5y = 250, or x - 1.5y = 0. Solving this equation requires another relationship.  Since the average price is unchanged, we have another constraint, the average is 125. So, let's consider the condition that average price is Rs.125. Then 100 + 150 + x - 1.5y = 250. This implies x - 1.5y = 0. This alone doesn't give a solution. We can express y in terms of x and then use the average price condition to find x.  This gives y=2x/3.  Substituting this into the sum equation is not practical. However, let's check the options. If x = 37.5, then the new price of A is 137.5.  The average price must be 125, so the new price of B must be 250 - 137.5 = 112.5.  The percentage decrease in B is (150-112.5)/150 = 25%. This satisfies the condition.

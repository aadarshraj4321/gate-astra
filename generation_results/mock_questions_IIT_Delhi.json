S2 = n[2a + (n - 1)d]/2 = n[2(1) + (n - 1)4]/2 = n(2n + 2).  Setting S1 = S2 gives n(2n + 1) = n(2n + 2), which implies 2n + 1 = 2n + 2, which is impossible.  Let's correct the question; the number of terms are 2n and n respectively.  S1 = n(2(1) + (2n-1)2)/2 = n(2n+1). S2 = n/2(2(1) + (n-1)4) = n(2n+2).  Then n(2n+1) = n(2n+2) gives 2n+1 = 2n+2, which is impossible.  The error is likely in assuming both AP have n terms. Correct approach: n[2 + (2n-1)2] = n[2 + (n-1)4]. Then 4n = 4n, which is always true. The sum of the first AP is n(4n). The sum of the second AP is n(2+4n-4) = n(4n-2). Thus, n(4n) = n(4n-2) which implies 4n = 4n -2, impossible.  Let's try to assume equal sums: n(2a1 + (2n-1)d1)/2 = n(2a2 + (n-1)d2)/2.  2 + (2n - 1)2 = 2 + (n - 1)4. 4n = 4n. We must have made an error in understanding the problem. Assuming it should have been the sum of 2n terms and n terms equal, we have n(2+ (2n-1)2) = n/2(2 + (n-1)4), which simplifies to 4n = 2n + 2, leading to n=1.",

This can be factored as a(r-1)^2 = 4.  Also, since they form a geometric progression, the middle term squared equals the product of the other two terms. Thus (ar)^2 = a*ar^2. This doesn't provide further information.  Let's try a specific case: If r=3, we could have a=1. The GP is 1,3,9. Adding gives 3,6,18. 2(6) = 12 and 3+18 = 21. This is incorrect. Let's use the arithmetic progression condition: 2(ar+3) = (a+2) + (ar^2+9) => 2ar + 6 = ar^2 + a + 11 => ar^2 -2ar + a + 5 = 0. If a=1, r^2 - 2r + 6 = 0, which has no real roots. If r=3, 9a - 6a + a + 5 = 0 => 4a = -5.  Let's reconsider 2(ar+3) = a+2+ar^2+9.  This simplifies to ar^2 -2ar + a + 5 = 0.  If r=3, then 9a -6a + a + 5 = 0, so 4a=-5, which is not possible. If r=2, then 4a - 4a + a + 5 = 0, so a=-5. This is possible, the GP being -5, -10, -20, and the AP -3, -7, -11.  The common difference is -4. It seems the problem statement contains an error.",

Since ar = 4, a = 4/r.  Substituting gives 4/r + 4r = 10.  Multiplying by r, 4r^2 - 10r + 4 = 0, or 2r^2 -5r + 2 = 0. This factors to (2r-1)(r-2) = 0.  Since r > 1, r = 2. Then a = 2.

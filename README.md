# GATE-Astra: Forecast Next Gate Paper

GATE-Astra is an advanced AI-powered forecasting engine designed to predict the topic distribution, generate stylistically accurate mock questions, and create personalized study plans for the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) Computer Science examination.

This project moves beyond simple historical analysis by synthesizing multiple layers of intelligence into a single, cohesive forecast, providing a strategic edge to aspiring engineers.

## Core Features

*   **Multi-Layered Prediction Engine:** Fuses several AI signals to produce a final, robust forecast:
    *   **Statistical Analysis (Multiverse Simulation):** Runs 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations based on over a decade of past papers to identify statistically probable topic weights.
    *   **Academic Pulse (NPTEL Heat):** Analyzes the entire NPTEL CS curriculum to measure the "academic heat" and emphasis of core undergraduate topics.
    *   **Examiner's Mind Map (Professor Bias):** Models the specific research specializations of faculty at the organizing IIT using a Knowledge Graph, predicting their likely biases.

*   **Interactive Analytics Dashboard:** A comprehensive UI built with Streamlit that provides:
    *   **Topic Heatmaps:** Visualizes the predicted weightage for each subject.
    *   **Comparative Analysis:** Compares the current forecast against the organizing IIT's past behavior and the overall historical average.
    *   **Chain of Reasoning:** Deconstructs the prediction, showing the strength of each underlying AI signal for the top-predicted subjects.

*   **Personalized Student Arsenal:**
    *   **Custom Study Planner:** Generates a prioritized study schedule based on the Oracle's forecast and the user's self-assessed subject proficiency.
    *   **AI-Powered Mock Question Bank:** A library of 500+ high-quality mock questions generated by a state-of-the-art LLM (Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash), tailored to the specific style and topic focus of the organizing IIT.

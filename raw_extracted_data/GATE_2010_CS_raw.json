Please check all pages\nand reporl discrepancy, if any.\n\nWrite your registration sumber. your name and name of the examination centre at the specified\nlocations on the right half of the Optical Respanse Sheet (ORS).\n\nUsing HB pencil, darken the appropriate bubble under each digit of your registration number and the\nletlers corresponding ta your paper code.\n\nAll questions in this paper are of objective lype.\n\nQuestions must be answered on the ORS by darkening the appropnate bubble (marked A, B, C, 1D)\nusing HB pencil against the question number on the lefi hand side of the GRS. For cach question\ndarken the bubble of the correct answer. In case you wish Lo change an answer, crase the old\nanswer completely. More than one answer bubbled against a question will be treated as an incorrect\nresponse.\n\nThere are a total of 65 questions carrying 100 marks.\nQuestions Q.1 — Q.25 will carry L-mark each, and questions 0.26 - Q.55 will carry 2-marks each.\n\nQuestions 0.485 -— O.41 (2 pairs} are common data quesions and question pais (Q.52. 0.53) and\n(0.54. 0.55) are linked answer questions. The answer to the second question of the jinked answer\nquestions depends on the answer lo the first question of the pair.

The GA questions will begm on a fresh\npage starting from page 15.\n\nUn-attempted questions will carry zero marks.\n\nWrong answers will carry NEGATIVE marks. For Q.1 - 0.25 and Q.56 - Q.60, % mark will be\ndeducted for each wrong answer. For Q.26 - Q.5] and Q.61 — Q.65, 4 mark will be deducted for each\nwrong answer, The question pairs (Q.52, Q.53). and (0.54, 0.55) are qucsuons wilh linked answers.\nThere will be negative marks only for wrong answer to the first question of the linked answer question\npair ie. for G52 and Q.44, 4% mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. There is no negative\nmarking for ).53 and Q.55.\n\n. Calculator (without data connectivity) is allowed in the examination hall.\n.

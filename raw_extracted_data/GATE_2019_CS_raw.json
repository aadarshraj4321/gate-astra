Answer:\n\nA relational database contains two tables Student and Performance as shown below:\n\nStudent Performance\n\n| Roll_no. | Student_name Roll_no. | Subject_code | Marks |\n| 1 Amit 1 A 86 |\n| 2 Priya 1 B 95 |\n| 3 Vinit 1 C 90 |\n| 4 Rohan 2 A 89 |\n| 5 Smita 2 C 92 |\n\n3 C 80 |\n\nThe primary key of the Student table is Roll_no. For the Performance table, the columns\nRoll_no. and Subject_code together form the primary key. Consider the SQL query given\nbelow:\n\nSELECT S.Student_name, sum(P.Marks)\nFROM Student 5S, Performance P\nWHERE P.Marks > 84\n\nGROUP BY S.Student_name;\n\nThe number of rows returned by the above SQL query is\n\nConsider the following C program:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\nfloat sum = 0.0, j = 1.0, i = 2.0;\nwhile (i/j > 0.0625) {\nJrjtiyi\nsum = sum + i/j;\nprintf£(\"Sf\\n\", sum);\n}\nreturn 0;\n\n}\n\nThe number of times the variable sum will be printed, when the above program is executed,\n1S\n\nCS\n\n12/15\n\n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\n\nGATE 2019 Computer Science and Information Technology Set-2\n\nQ.53 Consider the following C program:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n\n{\nint a[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};\nint i, sum = 0, *b=a + 4;\n\nfor (i = 0; i < 5; itt)\n\nsum = sum + (*b — i) — *(b — i);\nprintf (“%d\\n”, sum);\nreturn 0;\n\n}\n\nThe output of the above C program is\n\nQ.54 In an RSA cryptosystem, the value of the public modulus parameter n is 3007.

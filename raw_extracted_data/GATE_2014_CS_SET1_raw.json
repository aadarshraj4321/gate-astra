Submit the scribble pad at\nthe end of the examination.\n\n5. You are allowed to use a non-programmable type calculator, however, sharing of\ncalculators is not allowed.\n\n6. The Question Palette displayed on the right side of screen will show the status of\neach question using one of the following symbols:\n\n1 | You have not visited the question yet.\nYou have not answered the question.\na You have answered the question.\n@ You have NOT answered the question, but have marked the question for review.\n\nal\n© You have answered the question, but marked it for review.\n\nThe Marked for Review status for a question simply indicates that you would like to look at\nthat question again. If a question is answered, but marked for review, then the answer will\nbe considered for evaluation unless the status is modified by the candidate.\n\nNavigating to a Question :\n\n7. To answer a question, do the following:\n\na. Click on the question number in the Question Palette to go to that question\ndirectly.\n\nb. Select an answer for a multiple choice type question by clicking on the bubble\nplaced before the 4 choices, namely A, B, C and D. Use the virtual numeric\nkeypad to enter a number as answer for a numerical type question.\n\nc. Click on Save & Next to save your answer for the current question and then go\nto the next question.\n\nd.

If the checkbox for an optional Section is not selected, the Save & Next button and\nthe Mark for Review & Next button will NOT be enabled for that Section. You will\n\n\n--- PAGE 2 ---\n\nonly be able to see questions in this Section, but you will not be able to answer\nquestions in the Section.\n\n16. After clicking the Save & Next button for the last question in a Section, you will\nautomatically be taken to the first question of the next Section in sequence.\n\n17. You can move the mouse cursor over the name of a Section to view the answering\nstatus for that Section.\n\nChanging the Optional Section :\n\n18. After answering the chosen optional Section, partially or completely, you can change\nthe optional Section by selecting the checkbox for a new Section that you want to\nattempt. A warning message will appear along with a table showing the number of\nquestions answered in each of the previously chosen optional Sections and a\ncheckbox against each of these Sections. Click on a checkbox against a Section that\nyou want to reset and then click on the RESET button. Note that RESETTING a Section\nwill DELETE all the answers for questions in that Section. Hence, if you think that you\nmay want to select this Section again later, you will have to note down your answers\nfor questions in that Section. If you do not want to reset the Section and want to\ncontinue answering the previously chosen optional Section, then click on the BACK\nbutton.\n\n19. If you deselect the checkbox for an optional Section in the top bar, the following\nwarning message will appear: \"Deselecting the checkbox will DELETE all the answers\nfor questions in this Section. Do you want to deselect this Section?” If you want to\ndeselect, click on the RESET button. If you do not want to deselect, click on the BACK\nbutton.\n\n20.
